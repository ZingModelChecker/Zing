# Zing
Zing : An explicit state model checker for concurrent and message passing programs.

The goal of the Zing project is to build a flexible and scalable systematic state space exploration infrastructure for software.
Zing is a flexible and scalable infrastructure for exploring states of concurrent software systems. This infrastructure can be used for validating software at various levels: high-level protocol descriptions, work-flow specifications, web services, device drivers, and protocols in the core of the operating system. Zing is currently being used for developing drivers for Windows and Windows Phone.
