This infrastructure can be used for validating software at various levels: high-level protocol descriptions, work-flow specifications, web services, device drivers, and protocols in the core of the operating system. Zing is currently being used for developing drivers for Windows and Windows Phone.\r\n\r\nFor more details and documentation.\r\nhttp://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/zing/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
